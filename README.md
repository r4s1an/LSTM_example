# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

This repository provides an example of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast household consumption. The aim is to demonstrate how LSTMs can be applied to time series data and to highlight the importance of having a substantial amount of data for training these models effectively.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the performance of LSTM models on household consumption data using different training data lengths:

1 year of hourly data
3 months of hourly data
1 month of hourly data
2 weeks of hourly data

The objective is to predict the next 12 data points and observe how the amount of training data impacts the model's performance.
